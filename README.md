CS50 Coding Challenges
-----------------------

1) cs50_pset1_change.py: python program which calculates the amount of cash change required for a purchase and tells the cashier what the most efficent (i.e fewest coins/notes) set of denominations is in order to meet the change requirement.

2) cs50_pset1_mario.py: python program which displays a staircase made of "#'s" depending on the user input (limited to a positive integer between 1 and 8).

3) cs50_pset2_caesar.py: python program which ciphers a user input message by reversing the message and offsetting unicode values of the ascii characters within the message, dependent on a user input. The program then deciphers the message as long as the correct password is entered.
